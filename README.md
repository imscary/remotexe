```
## **Step 2**

## **Step 3**
### Rename the remotexe.exe to the paste ID
#### Example:
- **from `remotexe.exe` rename to `9NcgwJK1.exe`
## **Step 4**
### Send it to anyone who uses windows.

# IT'S NOT MY FAULT IF REMOTEXE IS USED MALICIOUSLY! THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO MAKE FILE TRANSFER EASIER AND MORE DYNAMIC
